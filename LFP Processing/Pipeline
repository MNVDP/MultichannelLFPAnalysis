Pipeline
========

Recording
---------

- TDT OpenWorkbench for recording data (w/ Coloured_Oddball_*.rcx)

- Behavioural video recording with <> Python 2. script


Post-recording
--------------

- zip and copy LFP data to server

- copy videos, diary file, saveStruct files to server (Videos and saveStruct go to "LFP\COLLATED\<datestamp>\Videos" and "LFP\COLLATED\<datestamp>\MAT", respectively)

- copy videos to folder/s under "C:\MotionDetection\Data", identify and snapshot exemplar frame which is then used to determine ROI topleft point of MotionDetection analyses in anc files

- run DLC on videos and copy output to server ("LFP\COLLATED\<datestamp>\DLC")


Preprocessing
-------------

- Behavioural videos
	- Architecture: "Collated\<datestamp>\Videos" and "Collated\<datestamp>\DLC"
	- SOFAS
	- Take savOut file ("Matthew\TDTs\SleepData\SavOut") and place into "SPECIFIC" folder

- LFP
	- Architecture: "Data\<datestamp [e.g. 090222]>\<Experiment [e.g. 090222_RedLightOvernight]>"
	- preprocess_01_converttdt_*
	- Copy MAT files to "MAT" folder within "Processed\<datestamp>\LFP", copy stitch list to same root location
	- Stitcher (Requires copying of stitch CSV)


Analysis
--------

- SASIFRAS
	- Generates integ file ("Matthew\TDTs\SleepData\IntegOut") in folder

- Oddball_Processing (Requires SASIFRAS integ file in folder)
